Of course. My apologies for misunderstanding. Here is the development strategy document focusing exclusively on the **User Profile Management function** for each role.

# **User Profile Management: Development Strategy**

This document outlines the strategic development plan for the user profile functionality across the three core user segments: **Customers**, **Hosts**, and **Admins**. The focus is on the specific features related to creating, managing, and moderating user profile information.

---

## **1. Customer Profile Strategy**

### üéØ **Mission**
To provide a simple, secure, and personal space where customers can easily manage their information, view their activity, and build a trusted identity on the platform.

---

### üöÄ **Key Initiatives**

1.  **Core Information Management:** Allow users to view and update their essential personal details, such as name, phone number, and profile picture.
2.  **Security and Access Control:** Provide tools for users to manage their account security, including password changes and viewing linked social accounts from OAuth2.
3.  **Activity Hub:** Integrate a user's booking history directly into their profile page, making it a central hub for all their interactions with the platform.

---

### üó∫Ô∏è **Phased Roadmap**

* **Phase 1 (Core MVP):**
    * View and edit basic profile fields (Full Name, Phone Number).
    * Ability to change the account password.
    * View the email address associated with the account (non-editable).
    * See which social accounts (e.g., Google) are linked.

* **Phase 2 (Enhancements):**
    * Functionality to upload and change a profile picture (avatar).
    * A dedicated section within the profile to display a list of past and upcoming bookings.
    * Manage basic notification preferences (e.g., promotional emails on/off).

* **Phase 3 (Advanced Features):**
    * Ability to add personal preferences that could influence future recommendations (e.g., "I prefer quiet places," "I travel with pets").
    * Download an archive of personal data for GDPR/privacy compliance.

---

### üìä **Metrics for Success (KPIs)**
* **Profile Completion Rate:** Percentage of users who have added a name and phone number.
* **Feature Adoption:** Percentage of users who have uploaded a profile picture.
* **User Satisfaction:** Reduced number of support tickets related to changing personal information.

## **2. Host Profile Strategy**

### üéØ **Mission**
To provide a comprehensive and dual-purpose profile system that allows hosts to **securely manage their private business information** while also creating a **professional and trustworthy public-facing persona** to attract guests.

---

### üöÄ **Key Initiatives**

1.  **Private Data Management:** A secure section for managing sensitive information necessary for operations and payouts, such as contact details, identity documents, and bank account information.
2.  **Public-Facing Professional Profile:** Tools for hosts to craft a compelling public profile that guests will see, including a bio, professional photo, and spoken languages.
3.  **Verification and Trust System:** A clear process for hosts to become "Verified," building guest confidence and improving the credibility of their listings.

---

### üó∫Ô∏è **Phased Roadmap**

* **Phase 1 (Core MVP):**
    * Ability to edit all basic personal information (Name, Phone).
    * A secure form to add and manage private payout information (Bank Account Details). This is critical for getting paid.
    * Functionality to write and save a public-facing bio.

* **Phase 2 (Enhancements):**
    * Upload a professional profile picture (distinct from their homestay photos).
    * A backend process for hosts to submit identification documents for verification.
    * Display a "Verified Host" badge on their profile and listings once approved by an admin.

* **Phase 3 (Advanced Features):**
    * Automatically display key performance stats on their public profile (e.g., "Response Rate," "Years on Platform").
    * Ability to link to professional social media or personal websites.

---

### üìä **Metrics for Success (KPIs)**
* **Payout Information Completion Rate:** Percentage of hosts who have successfully added their bank details.
* **Verification Rate:** Percentage of active hosts who have completed the ID verification process.
* **Guest Confidence:** Correlation between detailed host profiles and higher booking rates.

---

## **3. Admin Strategy for Profile Management**

### üéØ **Mission**
To equip administrators with **efficient, secure, and auditable tools** for overseeing and managing all user profiles, ensuring platform safety, data integrity, and effective user support. The focus is on management of *other* users, not their own admin profile.

---

### üöÄ **Key Initiatives**

1.  **User Profile Moderation:** Provide a centralized interface for admins to search, view, and edit user profile information to resolve issues, correct data, or enforce platform policies.
2.  **Account Status and Role Management:** Implement functionality to change a user's status (e.g., `Active`, `Suspended`, `Banned`) and role (e.g., `Customer`, `Host`) directly from their profile view.
3.  **Host Verification Workflow:** Build a dedicated backend system for admins to review submitted host documents, communicate with hosts regarding their application, and approve or deny verification requests.

---

### üó∫Ô∏è **Phased Roadmap**

* **Phase 1 (Core MVP):**
    * Ability to search for any user by email or name.
    * View the complete profile data for any user (respecting sensitive data privacy where needed).
    * Ability to manually edit basic user fields (Name, Phone).
    * Functionality to delete or suspend a user account.

* **Phase 2 (Enhancements):**
    * A clear UI within a user's profile to change their role or status with a single click.
    * A dedicated "Host Verification" queue/dashboard where admins can see pending applications, view submitted documents, and approve/reject them.

* **Phase 3 (Advanced Features):**
    * **Audit Logs:** Automatically log any changes made to a user profile by an admin (i.e., "Admin X changed User Y's phone number on [Date]").
    * Ability to add internal notes to a user's profile that are only visible to other admins.

---

### üìä **Metrics for Success (KPIs)**
* **Host Verification Time:** Average time it takes for an admin to process a new host's verification request.
* **Support Ticket Resolution Time:** Time taken to resolve user issues that require admin intervention on their profile.
* **Data Accuracy:** Reduction in data-related errors after admin corrections.
